title: Match source parameter fixed in recommendations
category: fixed
author: Jose Javier Merchante <jjmerchante@bitergia.com>
issue: 875
notes: >
  Resolve an issue where the "match source" option in unify and recommendation
  jobs was being applied to both emails and names. With this update, this option
  will now only apply to usernames. Additionally, users can utilize name and email
  simultaneously without the constraint of applying the "match source" option across
  all parameters.
